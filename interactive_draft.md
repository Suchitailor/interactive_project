# Natural Disasters 1970 - 2021

Suchi Tailor

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
Initially, I had considered a scrollytelling map that walked the reader through data on the deadliest natural disasters. Ultimately, I was dissatisfied with the data I was finding regarding the specific natural disasters, so I chose to do a more broad stroke approach of what natural disasters have looked like over time and how it has impacted specific countries (option B). 

My first draft of this work included a line chart, which you can see on the main branch. As soon as I had it working, I realized that frequencies were much better demonstrated through a bar chart, so I pivoted to a stacked bar chart. 


## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
My existing dataset is fairly comprehensive, so I haven't run into any specific challenges yet. I will say that the cleaning part is somewhat extensive as prepare different files for each visualization; but from my understanding, it is largely easier to do this in Polars than in d3.

## Walk us through an interaction, either in words or you can record a quick 2-3 minute video.
As of right now, the plan is for the reader to see a global overview of natural disasters and then progress into country breakdowns. Both bar charts have a tooltip that allow the reader to see the number of storms within a certain category for any given year. 

Through peer review, I realized it could be beneficial to add buttons to allow the reader to choose which natural disasters they want displayed for legibility. I am also still considering adding data around the economic impact of the natural disasters both globally and where available, at a regional level. 

## Include a _numbered_ list of questions for us to respond to.

1. For my country breakdown, I struggled to make the y-axis only have whole numbers... this may be an office hour question but would love any tips you have on this. Thanks!
